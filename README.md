## Tech Stack

- **NuxtJS**: Nuxt.js is a free and open-source framework for creating Vue.js applications. It's designed to simplify and accelerate the development of universal or server-side rendered (SSR) Vue.js applications.

- **Supabase**: An open-source platform that provides a set of tools and services for building applications with databases.

- **Redis**: An open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.
